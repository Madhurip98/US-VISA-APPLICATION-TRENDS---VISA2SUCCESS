# US-VISA-APPLICATION-TRENDS---VISA2SUCCESS
Academic project using R, PowerBI, AutoML 

The data set that we have acquired contains data for the various attributes correlating to the visa
application of the United States. The goal of this project is to assist in the decision making process
of our clients through analyzing various relationships amongst the variables and help to boost the
success rate of visa application of our clients with the help from our predictive model. 

Employers or organizations looking forward to hiring or admitting international applicants will gain an insight
into the type of visa, number of applicants and overall process to be followed. Additionally, the
applicant will be able to have a clear understanding of the opportunities with probability of
approval.
